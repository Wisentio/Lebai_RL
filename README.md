# Lebai_RL

This code is divided into learning.py script - which creates/modifies a file (on default - qtable.npy) that stores the qtable

On the other hand - there is the sim.py script, which creates a simulation of a robot with 6 dof (predefined model of kuka_iiwa from pybullet is used) 

To run the script, run the sim.py code.
